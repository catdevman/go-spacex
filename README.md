# go-spacex

go-spacex is a Go client library for accessing the [SpaceX API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API)

## Installation ##

go-spacex is compatible with modern Go releases in module mode, with Go installed:

```bash
go get github.com/catdevman/go-spacex/
```

will resolve and add the package to the current development module, along with its dependencies.

Alternatively the same can be achieved if you use import in a package:

```go
import "github.com/catdevman/go-spacex/spacex"
```

and run `go get` without parameters.
